                <p class="block-text">One of my favourite things, is to think about new idea 
                    that just popped out in my mind.
                    So, as a CS student with a drive to solve problems, I'm looking for technologicals 
                    ways to implement them.
                    Therefore, on my spare time I've learned Android
                    development and Fullstack - so I can create apps for any idea.</p>
                <p class="block-text">Being creative is part of me. I believe in thinking out of the
                    box. Always looking to learn, get expertise and gain more skills, and using them to produce exciting things.</p>
                <p class="block-text">Besides of study and develop, I like to do sport - espacially running.
                    I found sport relaxing and mindset changing. Basically it's an integral part of my life.</p>

                <p class="block-text">'Find Your Cofeece' is a mobile Android app, made for connecting coffee-restaurants owners
                    with people which work remotely, in their coffee-restaurants.<br>
                    This platfrom made for both sides. Therefore either the clients or the owners can use this app,
                    and get win-win situation.<br>
                    Let me explain. Think about how much time remotely employees spend in coffee-restaurants, and now
                    think about the owners - which want to give there clients good service, and on the other hand - 
                    they can get more clients for there coffee-restaurants.<br></p>

                <p class="block-text">During .NET/C# course at MTA, we built a program for managing a vehicles garage.
                    At this program we learned some of the important principles in OOP design and programming.<br>
                    We used OOP prinicles such as Polymorphism - which was one of the main subject of this project,
                    as long with Aggregation and Encupsulation.<br>
                    Furthermore, we used Design Patterns concepts such as Bridge and Abstract Factory.
                    In this project I've learned the most, as it was covered those principles and was big project.<br>
                    My partner for this project was Idan.<br>

                <div class="buffer"></div>
                <p class="block-text">As part of the Computers Network course at MTA, we built a web server by 
                    implementing HTTP and TCP protocols, using C. It was one of my comprehensive projects, which I've learned 
                    basic concepts in Computers Network. With this project, I understood more about Computer Netowrk in general,
                    and about HTTP/TCP in particular.<br>
                    Actually, it was one of the funnest project I did, and I figured out why the Internet is intresting.<br>

                <p class="block-text">On the first semester, on 2nd year of CS study at MTA - there was an OOP in C++ course.
                    During this course we learned the fundamentals of OOP. We went deeply through C++ featuers and concepts, 
                    which are similar to other Object-Oriented programming languages.<br>
                    Therefore, we made a final project which went through all along with the course. The project was 
                    to create an Ecommerce system, and by that understand the "behind the scenes" concepts.<br></p>
