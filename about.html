<div>
    <p class="block-text">One of my favourite things, is to think about new idea 
        that just popped out in my mind.
        So, as a CS student with a drive to solve problems, I'm looking for technologicals 
        ways to implement them.
        Therefore, on my spare time I've learned Android
        development and Fullstack - so I can create apps for any idea.</p>
    <p class="block-text">Being creative is part of me. I believe in thinking out of the
        box. Always looking to learn, get expertise and gain more skills, and using them to produce exciting things.</p>
    <p class="block-text">Besides of study and develop, I like to do sport - espacially running.
        I found sport relaxing and mindset changing. Basically it's an integral part of my life.</p>
